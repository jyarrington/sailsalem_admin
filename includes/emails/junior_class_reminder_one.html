    Please also not that your student's medical forms, parent/student agreement and swim forms need to be
    completed before they attend and handed in during morning check in. In the past we have asked that they
    are mailed but this year we are asking that they be passed in weekly. If you are registered for multiple
    weeks (offered to our paid programs only) please keep an extra copy for your records. They can be found
    <a href="http://admin.sailsalem.org/public/sail_salem_forms_2013.pdf">HERE</a>.

    If you have signed up for our Advanced Beginner program, or are in need of early drop-off / late pickup please email me with a phone number and I will be contacting you with payment options. Information
    concerning our extended day offerings can be found <a href="http://www.sailsalem.org/youth/list-of-items-to-bring/">Class Information</a>.
